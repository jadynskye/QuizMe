Quiz Game ðŸŽ¯

An interactive Quiz Game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I made this project to get better at JavaScript and understand how it connects with HTML and CSS. Building it helped me practice things like updating the screen when players click buttons, keeping score, and using events to make the quiz feel alive. It really helped me get more comfortable writing and organizing my own code.
